## Bevezetés



## Jelenlegi helyzet

The watches and the readers are already installed and they communicate with the system via Internet. These devices usually can process the response and approve or reject the transaction. Some of these devices can print simple reponse messages about the error. For example, if a childre wants to use the sauna then the entrace gate rejects their request. In another scenario, if a 17- years-old person wants to pay for alcohol then the bartender would recieveed a message about the restriction.

## Vágyálom rendszer

Our Wellness hotel wants to introduce a cashless system where our guests can buy services easily. The guests will get a watch which identify them. When many guests arrive they get their own watches but they will pay in a single bill. So the watch identies the customer but multiple customers can belong to a bill. When the guests leave, the give back the wathces that will be assign to new guests. Guests can pay for various services by simply touching the terminal similar to PayPass. We would like to monitor their consumption and give detailed invoice if needed. In addition, we would like to limit available services for guests so some service would be unavailabe for certain guests. For example, children could not by alcohol. Some services are provided by our employees for exmaple the drinks are served by a bartender in the bar. While other services can be accessed via its entrance such as the sanua.
